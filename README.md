# Red marrow S-factor

Script to calculate to the S-factor for different skeletal sites.

Per july 2020 it uses the Hough and O'Rilley phantoms from the
University of Florida, combined with ICRP-107-data for nuclide
information.

Needed things:

1) Input data-format, best with perhaps an input file?

2) Other nuclies, 90-Y, 131-I?

3) Usable interface - see point 1.
